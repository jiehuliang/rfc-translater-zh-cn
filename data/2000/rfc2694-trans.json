Network Address Translators (NATs) attempt to provide transparent routing between hosts in disparate address realms of the same routing class. Typically, NATs exist at the border of a stub domain, hiding private addresses from external addresses. This document identifies the need for DNS extensions to NATs and outlines how a DNS Application Level Gateway (DNS_ALG) can meet the need. DNS_ALG modifies payload transparently to alter address mapping of hosts as DNS packets cross one address realm into another. The document also illustrates the operation of DNS_ALG with specific examples.",

The DNS name lookup for private hosts (from external hosts) do not mandate fresh private-external address binding, as all private hosts are bound to a single pre-defined external address. However, reverse name lookups for the NAPT external address will not map to any of the private hosts and will simply map to the NAPT router.

In the case of NAT supported private networks, primary and backup servers are advised to be located in the same private domain (say, private.zone) so zone transfer is not across the domain and DNS_ALG support for zone transfer is not an issue. In the case a secondary name server is located outside the private domain, zone transfers must not be permitted for non-static address assignments. Primary and secondary servers are required to be within the same private domain because all references to data in the zone had to be captured. With dynamic address assignments and bindings, it is impossible to translate the axfr data to be up-to-date. Hence, if a secondary server for private.zone were to be located external to the domain, it would contain bad data. Note, however, the requirement outlined here is not in confirmence with RFC 2182, which recommends primary and secondary servers to be placed at topologically and geographically dispersed locations on the Internet.",
