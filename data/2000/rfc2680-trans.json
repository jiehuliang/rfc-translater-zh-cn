If they inject \"too much\" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service.",

If routers can recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the measurements will not reflect actual user traffic. If an attacker injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss rate will be artificially lowered. Therefore, the measurement methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from \"normal\" traffic. Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks.",
