The term \"resolver\" is used in this document to indicate a service that translates URNs to URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) or URCs (Uniform Resource Characteristics). Some resolvers may provide direct access to resources as well. An RDS helps in finding a resolver to contact for further resolution. It is worth noting that some RDS designs may also incorporate resolver functionality. This function of URN resolution is a component of the realization of an information infrastructure. In the case of this work, that infrastructure is to be available, \"in the Internet\" or globally, and hence the solutions to the problems we are addressing must be globally scalable. In this document, we are focussing specifically on the design of RDS schemes.",

      "text": "The Uniform Resource Identifier Working Group defined a naming architecture, as demonstrated in a series of three RFCs 1736 [1], 1737 [2], and 1738 [3]. Although several further documents are needed to complete the description of that architecture, it incorporates three core functions often associated with \"naming\": identification, location, and mnemonics or semantics. By location, we mean fully-qualified Domain Names or IP addresses, possibly extended with TCP ports and/or local identifiers, such as pathnames. Names may provide the ability to distinguish one resource from another, by distinguishing their \"names\". Names may help to provide access to a resource by including \"location\" information. In addition, names may have other semantic or mnemonic information that either helps human users remember or figure out the names, or includes other semantic information about the resource being named. The URI working group concluded that there was need for persistent, globally unique identifiers, distinct from location or other semantic information; these were called URNs. These \"names\" provide identity, in that if two of them are \"the same\" (under some simple rule of canonicalization), they identify the same resource. Furthermore, the group decided that these \"names\" were generally to be for machine, rather than human, consumption. Finally, with these guidelines for RDS's, this group has recognized the value of the separation of name assignment management from name resolution management.",

Given this requirement on URNs, one must ask about its implication for an RDS. Does ubiquity imply a guarantee of RDS resolution everywhere? Does ubiquity imply resolution to the same information about resolution everywhere? In both cases the answer is probably not. One cannot make global, systemic guarantees, except at an expense beyond reason. In addition there may be policy as well as technical reasons for not resolving in the same way everywhere. It is quite possible that the resolution of a URN to an instance of a resource may reach different instances or copies under different conditions. Thus, although a URN anywhere refers to the same resource, in some environments under some conditions, and at different times, due to either the vagaries of network conditions or policy controls a URN may sometimes be resolvable and other times or places not. Ubiquitous resolution cannot be assumed simply because naming is ubiquitous. On the other hand wide deployment and usage will be an important feature of any RDS design.",
      "zh-CHS": "RFC 1737中所述的URN是全局定义的；它们无处不在，因为任何上下文中的任何位置的URN都标识相同的资源。鉴于对URN的这一要求，必须询问其对RDS的含义。无处不在是否意味着处处都能保证RDS解决方案？普遍性是否意味着各地的分辨率信息相同？在这两种情况下，答案可能都不是。人们无法做出全球性、系统性的保证，除非付出超出理性的代价。此外，可能有政策和技术原因导致各地不能以同样的方式解决问题。URN到资源实例的解析很可能会在不同的条件下到达不同的实例或副本。因此，尽管URN anywhere指的是相同的资源，但在某些环境中，在某些条件下，在不同的时间，由于网络条件或策略控制的变幻莫测，URN有时可能是可解决的，而在其他时间或地点则不是。不能仅仅因为命名是普遍存在的就假定普遍存在的解析。另一方面，广泛的部署和使用将是任何RDS设计的一个重要特征。"

      "text": "Within the URI community there has been a concept used frequently that for lack of a better term we will call a _hint_. A hint is something that helps in the resolution of a URN; in theory we map URNs to hints as an interim stage in accessing a resource. In practice, an RDS may map a URN directly into the resource itself if it chooses to. It is very likely that there will be hints that are applicable to large sets of URNs, for example, a hint that indicates that all URNs with a certain prefix or suffix can be resolved by a particular resolver. A hint may also have meta-information associated with it, such as an expiration time or certification of authenticity. We expect that these will stay with a hint rather than being managed elsewhere. We will assume in all further discussion of hints that they include any necessary meta-information as well as the hint information itself. Examples of hints are: 1) the URN of a resolver service that may further resolve the URN, 2) the address of such a service, 3) a location at which the resource was previously found. The defining feature of hints is that they are only hints; they may be out of date, temporarily invalid, or only applicable within a specific locality. They do not provide a guarantee of access, but they probably will help in the resolution process. By whatever means available, a set of hints may be discovered. Some combination of software and human choice will determine which hints will be tried and in what order.",
      "zh-CHS": "在URI社区中，有一个经常使用的概念，由于缺乏更好的术语，我们将其称为_hint!。提示有助于解决URN问题；理论上，我们将URN映射到提示，作为访问资源的过渡阶段。实际上，如果RDS选择将URN直接映射到资源本身，则它可以将URN映射到资源本身。很可能会有适用于大型URN集的提示，例如，指示具有特定前缀或后缀的所有URN都可以由特定解析程序解析的提示。提示还可能具有与其相关联的元信息，例如过期时间或真实性认证。我们预计，这些将保持一个暗示，而不是在其他地方管理。在所有关于提示的进一步讨论中，我们将假设它们包括任何必要的元信息以及提示信息本身。提示的示例有：1）可能进一步解析URN的解析程序服务的URN，2）此类服务的地址，3）以前找到资源的位置。提示的定义特征是它们只是提示；它们可能过时、暂时无效或仅适用于特定地区。它们不能保证访问，但它们可能有助于解决问题。通过任何可用的方法，都可以发现一组提示。软件和人类选择的某种组合将决定尝试哪些提示以及尝试的顺序。"

      "text": "We must assume that most resolutions of URNs will be provided by the use of locally stored hints, because maintaining a database of globally available, completely up-to-date location information is infeasible for performance reasons. There are a number of circumstances in which one can imagine that hints become invalid, either because a resource has moved or because a different URN resolver service has taken over the responsibility for resolution of the URN. Hints may be found in a variety of places. It is generally assumed that a well engineered system will maintain or cache a set of hints for each URN at each location where that URN is found. These may have been acquired from the owner of the resources, a recommendation of the resource, or one of many other sources. In addition, for those situations in which those hints found locally fail, a well engineered system will provide a fall-back mechanism for discovering further hints. It is this fall-back mechanism, an RDS, that is being addressed in this document. As with all hints, there can never be a guarantee that access to a resource will be available to all clients, even if the resource is accessible to some. However, an RDS is expected to work with reasonably high reliability, and, hence, may result in increased response time.",
      "zh-CHS": "我们必须假设，URN的大多数分辨率将通过使用本地存储的提示来提供，因为出于性能原因，维护一个全局可用、完全最新的位置信息数据库是不可行的。在许多情况下，您可以想象提示会变得无效，这可能是因为资源已移动，或者是因为不同的URN解析程序服务已接管URN解析的责任。在很多地方都可以找到提示。一般认为，精心设计的系统会在每个URN所在的位置为每个URN维护或缓存一组提示。这些可能是从资源所有者、资源推荐人或许多其他来源中获得的。此外，对于那些在本地发现的提示失败的情况，精心设计的系统将提供一种回退机制来发现进一步的提示。本文档中讨论的正是这种回退机制，即RDS。与所有提示一样，永远不能保证所有客户端都可以访问资源，即使某些客户端可以访问该资源。然而，预期RDS以相当高的可靠性工作，因此可能导致响应时间增加。"

It is probably the case that nothing will last forever, but in the time frame of resources, users of those resources, and the systems to support the resources, the identifier should be considered to be persistent or have a longer lifetime than those other entities. There are two assumptions that are implied by longevity of URNs: mobility and evolution. Mobility will occur because resources may move from one machine to another, owners of resources may move among organizations, or the organizations themselves may merge, partition, or otherwise transforms themselves. The Internet is continually evolving; protocols are being revised, new ones created, while security policies and mechanisms evolve as well. These are only examples. In general, we must assume that almost any piece of the supporting infrastructure of URN resolution will evolve. In order to deal with both the mobility and evolution assumptions that derive from the assumption of longevity, we must assume that users and their applications can remain independent of these mutating details of the supporting infrastructure.",

      "text": "This third assumption has several corollaries. First, we assume that the publisher of a resource can choose resolver services, independently of choices made by others. At any given time, the owner of a namespace may choose a particular URN resolver service for that delegated namespace. Such a URN resolver service may be outside the RDS service model, and only identified or located by the RDS service. Second, it must be possible to make a choice among RDS services. The existence of multiple RDS services may arise from the evolution of an RDS service, or development of new ones. Although at any given time there is likely to be only one or a small set of such services, the number is likely to increase during a transition period from one architecture to another. Thus, it must be assumed that clients can make a choice among a probably very small set of RDSs. Third, there must be independence in the choice about levels and models of security and authenticity required. This choice may be made by the owner of a naming subspace, in controlling who can modify hints in that subspace. A naming authority may delegate this choice to the owners of the resources named by the names it has assigned. There may be limitations on this freedom of choice in order to allow other participants to have the level of security and authenticity they require, for example, in order to maintain the integrity of the RDS infrastructure as a whole. Fourth, there is an assumption of independence of choice of the rule of canonicalization of URNs within a namespace, limited by any restrictions or constraints that may have been set by its parent namespace. This is a choice held by naming authorities over their own subnamespaces. Rules for canonicalization will be discussed further in the framework section below. Thus, there are assumptions of independence and isolation to allow for delegated, independent authority in a variety of domains.",

The number of users, both human and electronic, as well as the number of resources will continue to grow exponentially for the near term, at least. Hence the number of URNs will also increase similarly. In addition, with growth in sheer numbers is likely to come growth in the delegation of both naming authority and resolution authority. These facts mean that an RDS design must be prepared to handle increasing numbers of requests for inclusion, update and resolution, in a set of RDS servers perhaps inter-related in more complex ways. This is not to say that there will necessarily be more updates or resolutions per URN; we cannot predict that at this time. But, even so, the infrastructure may become more complex due to delegation, which may (as can be seen in Section 4 on the framework) lead to more complex rules for rewriting or extracting terms for staged resolution. Any design is likely to perform less well above some set of limits, so it is worth considering the growth limitations of each design alternative.",

In this context, there will always be room for improvement of services, through improved performance, better adaptability to new URN schemes, or lower cost, for example.

Ideally, the service would be providing exactly what the customers wanted and they in turn would not request more support than they need, but it seems extremely unlikely.

For example, suppose hint entries are being submitted in such volume that the hint servers are using up their excess capacity and need more disk space.

Denial of service is probably the most difficult of these areas of threats both to detect and to prevent, and we will therefore set it aside for the present as well, although it will be seen that solutions to other problems will also mitigate some of the problems of denial of service.

Since, in general it is in the business of storing and distributing information, most of its security policies may have to do with maintaining its own integrity, and are rather limited. Beyond that, to the degree possible, it should impose no policy on its customers, the publishers and users. It is they that may have policies that they would like supported by the RDS. To that end, an RDS should provide a spectrum of \"tools\" or mechanisms that the customers can cause to be deployed on their behalf to realize policies. An RDS may not provide all that is needed by a customer. A customer may have different requirements within his or her administrative bounds than outside. Thus, \"it must be possible...\" captures the idea that the RDS must generally provide the tools to implement policies as needed by the customers.",

It is important to note that it is the intention here that a single RDS scheme is likely to support names from many or all naming schemes, as embodied in their NIDs.",
      "zh-CHS": "关于RDS框架，有几点值得注意。首先，它允许确定支持特定RDS方案所需的协议、数据组织、分发和复制。其次，它保留了由规则产生的计算的位置。第三，它允许RDS数据库的分区（分布）不必与名称委派位于同一边界上。对于某些人来说，这似乎很激进，但是如果信息存储在平衡的B-树中，那么分区可能不会沿着命名机构委托边界进行（参见[7]）。最后，它允许对全局NID注册表进行开放访问。这是分布到每个客户端，还是在分布广泛的服务器中进行管理？需要注意的是，此处的意图是单个RDS方案可能支持多个或所有命名方案中的名称，如其NID中所体现的。"

      "text": "If we are to support more than one co-existing RDS scheme, there will need to be coordination among them with respect to storage and propagation of information and modifications. The issue is that generally it should be assumed that all information should be available through any operational RDS scheme. One cannot expect potential publishers to submit updates to more than one RDS scheme. Hence there will need to be a straightforward mapping of information from one to the other of these schemes. It is possible that that transformation will only go in one direction, because a newer RDS service is replacing an older one, which is not kept up to date, in order to encourage transfer to the newer one. Thus, at some point, updates may be made only to the newer one and not be made available to the older one, as is often done with library catalogs.",
      "zh-CHS": "如果我们要支持多个共存的RDS方案，则需要在信息的存储和传播以及修改方面进行协调。问题是，通常应假定所有信息都应通过任何可操作的RDS方案提供。不能期望潜在发布者向多个RDS方案提交更新。因此，需要将信息从一个方案直接映射到另一个方案。这种转变可能只会朝一个方向发展，因为新的RDS服务正在取代旧的RDS服务，而旧的RDS服务并没有保持最新，以鼓励向新的RDS服务转移。因此，在某些情况下，更新可能只对较新的目录进行，而对较旧的目录不可用，这是图书馆目录经常做的事情。"
