In the first case of setting the DF bit in all segments, if the initial packets are too large, then all of the initial packets will be dropped in the network. In the second case of setting the DF bit in only one segment, if the initial packets are too large, then all but one of the initial packets will be fragmented in the network. When the second case is followed, setting the DF bit in the last segment in the initial window provides the least chance for needless retransmissions when the initial segment size is found to be too large, because it minimizes the chances of duplicate ACKs triggering a Fast Retransmit.

This could result in an unnecessary retransmit timeout. For a large-window connection that is able to recover without a retransmit timeout, this could result in an unnecessarily-early transition from the slow-start to the congestion-avoidance phase of the window increase algorithm.

The same delayed ACK received during slow start causes the window to slide by two segments and then be incremented by one segment, resulting in a three-segment burst. While not necessarily typical, bursts of four and five segments for TCP are not rare.

In experiments over a 28.8 bps dialup channel [All97a, AHO98], a four-segment initial window decreased the transfer time of a 16KB file by roughly 10%, with no accompanying increase in the drop rate. A particular area of concern has been TCP performance over low speed tail circuits (e.g., dialup modem links) with routers with small buffers. A simulation study [SP97] investigated the effects of using a larger initial window on a host connected by a slow modem link and a router with a 3 packet buffer. The study concluded that for the scenario investigated, the use of larger initial windows was not harmful to TCP performance. Questions have been raised concerning the effects of larger initial windows on the transfer time for short transfers in this environment, but these effects have not been quantified. A question has also been raised concerning the possible effect on existing TCP connections sharing the link.",

The loss rate in networks where all TCP connections use an initial window of four segments is shown to be 1-2% greater than in a network where all connections use an initial window of one segment. This relationship held in scenarios where the loss rates with one-segment initial windows ranged from 1% to 11%. In addition, in networks where connections used an initial window of four segments, TCP connections spent more time waiting for the retransmit timer (RTO) to expire to resend a segment than was spent when using an initial window of one segment. The time spent waiting for the RTO timer to expire represents idle time when no useful work was being accomplished for that connection. These results show that in a very congested environment, where each connection's share of the bottleneck bandwidth is close to one segment, using a larger initial window can cause a perceptible increase in both loss rates and retransmit timeouts.",

In addition, a single segment dropped from an initial window of three segments might be repaired using the fast retransmit algorithm, depending on which segment is dropped and whether or not delayed ACKs are used.
