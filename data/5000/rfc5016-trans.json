While a DKIM signed message speaks for itself, there is ambiguity if a message doesn't have a valid first party signature (i.e., on behalf of the [RFC2822].From address): is this to be expected or not? For email, this is an especially difficult problem since there is no expectation of a priori knowledge of a sending domain's practices. This ambiguity can be used to mount a bid down attack that is inherent with systems like email that allow optional authentication: if a receiver doesn't know otherwise, it should not assume that the lack of a valid signature is exceptional without other information. Thus, an attacker can take advantage of the ambiguity and simply not sign messages. If a protocol could be developed for a domain to publish its DKIM signing practices, a message verifier could take that into account when it receives an unsigned piece of email.",
