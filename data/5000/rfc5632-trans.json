A trial was conducted in July 2008 with Pando Networks, Yale, and several ISP members of the P4P working group, which is part of the Distributed Computing Industry Association (DCIA). Comcast is a member of the DCIA's P4P Working Group, whose mission is to work with Internet Service Providers (ISPs), peer-to-peer (P2P) companies, and technology researchers to develop \"P4P\" mechanisms, such as so-called \"iTrackers\" (hereafter P4P iTrackers), that accelerate distribution of content and optimize utilization of ISP network resources. P4P iTrackers theoretically allow P2P networks to optimize traffic within each ISP, reducing the volume of data traversing the ISP's infrastructure and creating a more manageable flow of data. P4P iTrackers can also accelerate P2P downloads for end users.",

This work was discussed in greater detail at the 72nd meeting of the IETF, in Dublin, Ireland, in the ALTO BoF (Birds of a Feather meeting) on July 29, 2008.

Note that for each swarm, the number of downloaded bytes according to logging reports is very close to the number of downloads multiplied by file size. But they do not exactly match due to log report errors and duplicated chunks. One factor contributing to the differences in access network download activity is that different swarms have different numbers of downloaders, due to random variations during uniform random assignment of downloaders to swarms (see Table 1). One interesting observation is that Random has higher cancellation rate (3.17%) than that of the guided swarms (1.77%-2.22%).

From the perspective of P2P users, P4P iTrackers potentially deliver faster P2P downloads. At the same time, ISPs can increase the localization of swarms, enabling them to reduce bytes flowing over transit points, while also delivering an optimized P2P experience to customers. However, an internal analysis of varying levels of P4P iTracker adoption by ISPs leads us to believe that, while P4P iTracker-type mechanisms are valuable on a single ISP basis, the value of P4P iTrackers increases dramatically as many ISPs choose to deploy it.",

In this way, P2P users could choose to opt-in either explicitly or by their choice of P2P client in order to choose to use the P4P iTracker to improve performance, which benefits both the user and the ISP at the same time. Importantly in terms of privacy, the P4P iTracker makes available only network topology information, and would not in its current form enable an ISP, via the P4P iTracker, to determine which P2P clients were downloading any specific content, whether to determine, for example, if content was a song or a movie or even the title.",
