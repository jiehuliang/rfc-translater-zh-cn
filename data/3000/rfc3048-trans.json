It builds upon the experience gained during the deployment of several classes of contemporary reliable multicast transport, and attempts to pull out the commonalities between these classes of protocols into a number of building blocks. To that end, this document recommends that certain components that are common to multiple protocol classes be standardized as \"building blocks\". The remaining parts of the protocols, consisting of highly protocol specific, tightly intertwined functions, shall be designated as \"protocol cores\". Thus, each protocol can then be constructed by merging a \"protocol core\" with a number of \"building blocks\" which can be re-used across multiple protocols.",

A protocol may optionally provide delivery confirmation, i.e., a mechanism for receivers to inform the sender when data has been delivered. There are two types of confirmation, at the application data unit level and at the packet level. Application data unit confirmation is useful at the application level, e.g., to inform the application about receiver progress and to decide when to stop sending packets about a particular application data unit. Packet confirmation is useful at the transport level, e.g., to inform the transport level when it can release buffer space being used for storing packets for which delivery has been confirmed. Packet level confirmation may also aid in application data unit confirmation.",
