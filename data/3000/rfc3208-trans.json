In turn, the network element repeatedly forwards the NAK to the upstream PGM network element on the reverse of the distribution path from the source of the original data packet until it also receives an NCF from that network element.

These are congestion control, router assist, local retransmission, and a programmatic API for reliable multicast protocols of this class.
