This is not meant to provide an exhaustive list, but to provide a known set of tools that can be used when needed.",

Aside from a pleasing alliteration, these two touchstones provide a concise summary of the ideals that guide the IETF's decision making. The first implies an open process in which any technical opinion will be heard and any participant's concerns addressed; the second implies a recognition that any decision must be grounded in solid engineering and the known characteristics of the network and its uses. The aim of the IETF is to make the best possible engineering choices and protocol standards for the Internet as a whole, and these two principles guide it in making its choices and standards.",

These are valid concerns, and they point both to the need to retain rough consensus as the baseline mechanism and the need to exercise caution when using these alternate methods. More importantly though, they highlight the nature of these alternatives. They are primarily mechanisms that allow people to recognize the need for compromise in a new way, by backing away from entrenched technical positions and by putting the technical choice in the hands of the broader community.

Although it may appear that having a single representative of each proposal will have a null effect on the outcome, this is unlikely, except when there is a binary choice, because of the rules for decision-statement processing (c.f. 4.1.4.). As in 4.1, the working group notifies the IETF community that it intends to form a mixed review team by making a public announcement on the IETF-announce mailing list. That announcement should include a summary of the issue to be decided and a list of the Internet-Drafts containing the alternate proposals. It should also include the name and location of an archived mailing list for the external review team's deliberations.",
