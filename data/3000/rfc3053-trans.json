      "text": "The IPv6 global Internet as of today uses a lot of tunnels over the existing IPv4 infrastructure. Those tunnels are difficult to configure and maintain in a large scale environment. The 6bone has proven that large sites and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can do it, but this process is too complex for the isolated end user who already has an IPv4 connection and would like to enter the IPv6 world. The motivation for the development of the tunnel broker model is to help early IPv6 adopters to hook up to an existing IPv6 network (e.g., the 6bone) and to get stable, permanent IPv6 addresses and DNS names. The concept of the tunnel broker was first presented at Orlando's IETF in December 1998. Two implementations were demonstrated during the Grenoble IPng & NGtrans interim meeting in February 1999.",

In such a situation a more effective tunnel management may be achieved by having the TS periodically deliver to the TB IPv6 traffic and reachability statistics for every active tunnel. In this way, the TB can enforce a tunnel deletion after a period of inactivity without waiting for the expiration of the related lifetime which can be relatively longer (e.g., several days).",

In this way, in fact, when the user reconnects to the Internet, possibly using a different IPv4 address, he could just restart the tunnel by getting in touch with the TB again. The TB could then order a TS to re-create the tunnel using the new IPv4 address of the client but reusing the previously allocated IPv6 addresses. That way, the client could preserve a nearly permanent (static) IPv6 address even though its IPv4 address is dynamic. It could also preserve the associated DNS name.",
