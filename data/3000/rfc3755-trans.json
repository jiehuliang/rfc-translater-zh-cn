In RFC 2535, NXT records were only required to be returned as part of a non-existence proof. With DS, an unsecure referral returns, in addition to the NS, a proof of non-existence of a DS RR in the form of an NXT and SIG(NXT). RFC 2535 didn't specify how a resolver was to interpret a response with RCODE=0, AA=0, and both an NS and an NXT in the authority section. Some widely deployed 2535-aware resolvers interpret any answer with an NXT as a proof of non-existence of the requested record. This results in unsecure delegations being invisible to 2535-aware resolvers and violates the basic architectural principle that DNSSEC must do no harm -- the signing of zones must not prevent the resolution of unsecured delegations.",

Legacy resolvers may also be confused by seeing records they recognize (SIG and KEY) while being unable to find NXTs. Although it may seem unnecessary to fix that which is not obviously broken, it's far cleaner to change all of the type codes at once.
