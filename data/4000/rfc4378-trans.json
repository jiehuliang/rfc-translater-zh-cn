Load sharing typically takes place when multiple equal-cost paths exist between the ingress and egress of an LSP. In these cases, traffic is split among these equal-cost paths using a variety of algorithms. One such algorithm relies on splitting traffic between each path on a per-packet basis. When this is done, it is possible for some packets along the path to be delayed due to congestion or slower links, which may result in packets being received out of order at the egress. Detection and remedy of this situation may be left up to client applications that use the LSPs. For instance, TCP is capable of re-ordering packets belonging to a specific flow (although this may result in re-transmission of some of the mis-ordered packets).",
