A mobile node can keep its IP address constant as it moves from link to link, avoiding the signaling overhead and latency associated with changing the IP address. Software specifically for localized mobility management is not required on the mobile node, whereas IP-layer movement detection software may be necessary, and driver software for link-layer mobility is prerequisite.",

Any particular mobile node's route terminates at a mobile access gateway (MAG) [3], to which the mobile node attaches at its current access link. MAGs are responsible for updating the mobile node's route on the LMA as the mobile node moves. A MAG detects the arrival of a mobile node on its local access link based on handoff signaling that the mobile node pursues. The MAG may additionally monitor connectivity of the mobile node in order to recognize when the mobile node has left the local access link. The localized mobility management architecture therefore has two interfaces:",

      "text": "The localized mobility management architecture demands no specific protocol for a MAG to detect the arrival or departure of mobile nodes to and from its local access link and accordingly initiate route update signaling with an LMA. An appropriate mechanism may be entirely implemented at the link layer, such as is common for cellular networks. In that case, the IP layer never detects any movement, even when a mobile node moves from one link to another handled by a different MAG. If the link layer does not provide the necessary functionality, the mobile node must perform IP-layer movement detection and auto-configuration signaling, thereby providing the trigger for the MAG to update its route on the LMA. A mobile node identity, established by the localized mobility management domain when the mobile node initially connects and authenticates, enables the MAG to ascribe the decisive link- or IP-layer signaling to the correct mobile node. Some wireless access technologies may require the mobile node identity to be reestablished on every link-layer handoff.",

This is obvious if the attacker is on the original data plane path between the legitimate LMA and the mobile node's current MAG, which may happen independently of whether the attacker is on the original control plane path. If the attacker is not on this path, it may be able to leverage the localized mobility management protocol to redefine the prefix that the mobile node uses in IP address configuration. The attacker can then specify a prefix that routes to itself. Whether or not outgoing data plane packets sourced by the mobile node can be interfered with by an attacker off the original data plane path depends on the specific data plane forwarding mechanism within the localized mobility management domain. For example, if IP-in-IP encapsulation or an equivalent approach is used for outbound data plane packets, the packets can be forced to be routed through the attacker. On the other hand, standard IP routing may cause the packets to be relayed via a legitimate LMA and hence to circumvent the attacker.",

But a bogus host route is likely to take precedence over the routing information advertised by legitimate routers, which is usually less specific; hence, the attack should succeed even if the attacker is not supported by other routers. A difference between redirection in a routing protocol and redirection in localized mobility management is that the former impacts the routing tables of multiple routers, whereas the latter involves only the compromised MAG and an LMA.",

The mobile node then needs to reinitiate the network access authentication procedure, which the compromised MAG may prevent repeatedly until the mobile node moves to a different MAG.

The LMA will then establish a routing table entry for each of the non-existing mobile nodes. The unexpected growth of the routing table may eventually cause the LMA to reject legitimate route update requests. It may also decrease the forwarding speed for data plane packets due to higher route lookup latencies, and it may, for the same reason, slow down the responsiveness to control plane packets. Another adverse side effect of a high number of routing table entries is that the LMA, and hence the localized mobility management domain as a whole, becomes more susceptible to flooding packets from external attackers (see Section 4). The high number of superfluous routes increase the probability that a flooding packet, sent to a random IP address within the localized mobility management domain, matches an existing routing table entry at the LMA and gets tunneled to a MAG, which in turn performs address resolution on the local access link. At the same time, fewer flooding packets can be dropped directly at the LMA on the basis of a nonexistent routing table entry.",

The attack is conceivable both if the attacker and the mobile node are on separate links that connect to different MAGs, as well as if they are on separate, possibly virtual per-mobile-node links that connect to the same MAG. In the former case, two MAGs would think they see the mobile node and both would independently perform route update signaling with the LMA. In the latter case, route update signaling is likely to be performed only once, and the redirection of packets from the mobile node to the attacker is internal to the MAG. The mobile node can always recapture its traffic back from the attacker through another run of handoff signaling. But standard mobile nodes are generally not prepared to counteract this kind of attack, and even where network stacks include suitable functionality, the attack may not be noticeable early enough at the link or IP layer to quickly institute countermeasures. The attack is therefore disruptive at a minimum, and may potentially persist until the mobile node initiates signaling again upon a subsequent handoff.",

The attacker can trick a MAG into believing that a large number of mobile nodes have attached to the local access link and thus induce it to initiate route update signaling with an LMA for each mobile node assumed on link. The result of such an attack is both superfluous signaling overhead on the control plane as well as a high number of needless entries in the LMA's and MAG's routing tables. The unexpected growth of the routing tables may eventually cause the LMA to reject legitimate route update requests, and it may cause the MAG to ignore handoffs of legitimate mobile nodes onto its local access link. It may also decrease the LMA's and MAG's forwarding speed for inbound and outbound data plane packets due to higher route lookup latencies, and it may for the same reason slow down their responsiveness to control plane packets. An adverse side effect of this attack is that the LMA, and hence the localized mobility management domain as a whole, becomes more susceptible to flooding packets from external attackers (see Section 4). The high number of superfluous routes increases the probability that a flooding packet, sent to a random IP address within the localized mobility management domain, matches an existing routing table entry at the LMA and gets tunneled to a MAG, which in turn performs address resolution on the local access link. At the same time, fewer flooding packets can be dropped directly at the LMA on the basis of a nonexistent routing table entry.",

Attackers use IP spoofing mostly for reflection attacks or to hide their identities. The threat can be reasonably contained by a wide deployment of network ingress filtering [7] in routers, especially within access networks. This technique prevents IP spoofing to the extent that it ensures topological correctness of IP source address prefixes in to-be-forwarded packets. Where the technique is deployed in an access router, packets are forwarded only if the prefix of their IP source address is valid on the router's local access link. An attacker can still use a false interface identifier in combination with an on-link prefix. But since reflection attacks typically aim at off-link targets, and the enforcement of topologically correct IP address prefixes also limits the effectiveness of identity concealment, network ingress filtering has proven adequate so far. On the other hand, prefixes are not limited to a specific link in a localized mobility management domain, so merely ensuring topological correctness through ingress filtering becomes insufficient. An additional mechanism for IP address ownership verification is necessary to prevent an attacker from sending packets with an off-link IP source address.",

The LMA can discard packets for which the IP destination address is not registered in its routing table. But other packets must be encapsulated and forwarded. A target MAG as well as any mobile nodes attached to that MAG's local access link are also likely to suffer damage because the unrequested packets must be decapsulated and consume link bandwidth as well as processing capacities on the receivers. This threat is in principle the same as for denial of service on a regular IPv6 border router, but because the routing table lookups may enable the LMA to drop part of the flooding packets early on or, on the contrary, additional tunneling workload is required for packets that cannot be dropped, the impact of an attack against localized mobility management may be different.",
