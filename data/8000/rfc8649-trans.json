After the first transition, the Root CA is using the key pair that suffered the early release, and that transition causes the Root CA to generate the subsequent Root key pair. The second transition occurs when the Root CA is confident that the population of relying parties has completed the first transition, and it takes the Root CA to the freshly generated key pair. Of course, the second transition also causes the Root CA to generate another key pair that is reserved for future use. Queries for the CRLs associated with certificates that are subordinate to the self-signed certificate can give some indication of the number of relying parties that are still actively using the self-signed certificates.",
