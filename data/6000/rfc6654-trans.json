      "text": "This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969. The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd requires support by a device (the 6rd customer edge, or 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address. The alternative model described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels from an operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge rather than from customer equipment, and hence is termed \"Gateway-initiated 6rd\" (GI 6rd). The advantages of this approach are that it requires no modification to customer equipment and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment. The latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth environment.",
      "zh-CHS": "本文档提出了一种替代RFC 5969的IPv4基础设施上IPv6快速部署（第6rd）部署模型。基本的第六种模式允许IPv6主机通过IPv4接入网络使用四合六隧道访问IPv6网络。第6rd需要客户站点上的设备（第6rd客户边缘或第6rd CE）的支持，还必须为其分配IPv4地址。本文档中描述的替代模型从与运营商IPv4网络边缘并置的运营商自有网关而不是从客户设备启动六合四隧道，因此被称为“网关启动的6rd”（GI 6rd）。这种方法的优点是，它不需要修改客户设备，并避免将IPv4地址分配给客户设备。后一点意味着在高增长环境中，IPv4地址的压力更小。"

The estimated number of 6rd Gateways needed to serve this domain would be on the order of 3,300, each serving 30,000 customer devices. Assuming best-case compression for the Gateway addresses, the Gateway Identifier field has length o = 12 bits. If 6-in-4 tunneling is being used, this best case is more likely to be achievable than it would be if the IPv4 addresses belonged to the customer devices. The customer device index, which is a more controllable parameter, has length n = 15 bits.",
